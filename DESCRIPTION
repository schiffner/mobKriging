Title: Recursive Partitioning of Kriging Models
Description: mobKriging provides an interface for model-based recursive
    partitioning (mob) of Kriging models. This allows to build segmented
    Kriging models by computing decision trees where each terminal node is
    associated with a fitted Kriging model.
